# Linked List
My implementation of linked lists in ruby

A linked list is a linear collection of data elements called nodes that “point” to the next node by means of a pointer.

U can check out the project details [here](https://www.theodinproject.com/lessons/ruby-linked-lists)

### Methods
The LinkedList class contains a comprehensive set of methods for the data structure

- append(value)
- prepend(value)
- size
- at(index)
- pop
- contains?(value)
- find(value)
- to_s
- insert_at(value, index)
- remove_at(index)
