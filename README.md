# Ruby-practise-projects

A bunch of assignments from 'The Odin Project' that don't quite need their own repos

definitely feels like I've overcomplicated some of them but im quite satisfied with the end results

In chronological order the projects are:

- Ceasar Cipher
- Sub Strings
- Stock Picker
- Bubble Sort
- Tic Tac Toe
- Mastermind
- Event Manager
- Hangman
- Custom Enumerables
- Merge Sort
- Linked List
- Binary Search Tree
- Knights Travails 

All of these have a brief description in their respective directories

You can find these in the ruby programming category on The Odin Project website
