# Ruby-practise-projects

A bunch of assignments from 'The Odin Project' that dont quite need their own repos

definetely feels like I've overcomplicated some of them but im quite satisfied with the end results

In chronological order the projects are:

- Ceasar Cipher
- Sub Strings
- Stock Picker
- Bubble Sort
- Tic Tac Toe
- Mastermind
- Event Manager
- Hangman

You can find these in the ruby programming category on The Odin Project website
